Technical section for current DCR implementation.

## Sections

- [dcr.toml configuration](./configuration/)
- [Build profiles](./build-profiles/)
- [Project layout](./project-layout/)
- [Platforms and installation](./platforms-and-installers/)

## Important

- DCR keeps a `dcr.toml` template, but current build flow is focused on `src/main.c`.
- `clang` is used by default.
- Supported profiles are `debug` and `release`.
